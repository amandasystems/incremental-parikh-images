abstract = {We describe a uniform and efficient framework for checking the satisfiability of a large class of string constraints. The framework is based on the observation that both satisfiability and unsatisfiability of common constraints can be demonstrated through witnesses with simple patterns. These patterns are captured using flat automata each of which consists of a sequence of simple loops. We build a Counter-Example Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR) framework which contains both an under- and an over-approximation module. The flow of information between the modules allows to increase the precision in an automatic manner. We have implemented the framework as a tool and performed extensive experimentation that demonstrates both the generality and efficiency of our method.},
