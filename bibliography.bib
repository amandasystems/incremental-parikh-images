  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose a refined version of the Parikh image abstraction of finite automata to resolve string length constraints. We integrate this abstraction into the string solver SLOTH, where on top of handling length constraints, our abstraction is also used to speed-up solving other types of constraints. The experimental results show that our extension of SLOTH has good results on simple benchmarks as well as on complex benchmarks that are real-word combinations of transducer and concatenation constraints.},

We show here that a decidable logic is obtained if we use a modal fixpoint logic instead. We present a characterization of this logic by means of deterministic Presburger tree automata and show how it can be used to express numerical document queries. Surprisingly, the complexity of satisfiability for the extended logic is asymptotically the same as for the original fixpoint logic. The non-emptiness for Presburger tree automata (PTA) is pspace-complete, which is moderate given that it is already pspace-hard to test whether the complement of a regular expression is non-empty. We also identify a subclass of PTAs with a tractable non-emptiness problem. Further, to decide whether a tree t satisfies a formula ϕ is polynomial in the size of ϕ and linear in the size of t.},

  abstract  = {Efficient reasoning about strings is essential to a growing number of security and verification applications. We describe satisfiability checking techniques in an extended theory of strings that includes operators commonly occurring in these applications, such as {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}contains{\}}, {\backslash}mathsf {\{}index{\backslash}{\_}of{\}}{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}replace{\}}{\$}{\$}. We introduce a novel context-dependent simplification technique that improves the scalability of string solvers on challenging constraints coming from real-world problems. Our evaluation shows that an implementation of these techniques in the SMT solver cvc4 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art string solvers on benchmarks generated using PyEx, a symbolic execution engine for Python programs. Using a test suite sampled from four popular Python packages, we show that PyEx uses only {\$}{\$}41{\backslash}{\%} {\$}{\$}of the runtime when coupled with cvc4 than when coupled with cvc4's closest competitor while achieving comparable program coverage.},

  abstract   = {String analysis is the problem of reasoning about how strings are manipulated by a program. It has numerous applications including automatic detection of cross-site scripting, and automatic test-case generation. A&nbsp;popular string analysis technique includes symbolic executions, which at their core use constraint solvers over the string domain, a.k.a. string solvers. Such solvers typically reason about constraints expressed in theories over strings with the concatenation operator as an atomic constraint. In recent years, researchers started to recognise the importance of incorporating the replace-all operator (i.e. replace all occurrences of a string by another string) and, more generally, finite-state transductions in the theories of strings with concatenation. Such string operations are typically crucial for reasoning about XSS vulnerabilities in web applications, especially for modelling sanitisation functions and implicit browser transductions (e.g. innerHTML). Although this results in an undecidable theory in general, it was recently shown that the straight-line fragment of the theory is decidable, and is sufficiently expressive in practice. In this paper, we provide the first string solver that can reason about constraints involving both concatenation and finite-state transductions. Moreover, it has a completeness and termination guarantee for several important fragments (e.g. straight-line fragment). The main challenge addressed in the paper is the prohibitive worst-case complexity of the theory (double-exponential time), which is exponentially harder than the case without finite-state transductions. To this end, we propose a method that exploits succinct alternating finite-state automata as concise symbolic representations of string constraints. In contrast to previous approaches using nondeterministic automata, alternation offers not only exponential savings in space when representing Boolean combinations of transducers, but also a possibility of succinct representation of otherwise costly combinations of transducers and concatenation. Reasoning about the emptiness of the AFA language requires a state-space exploration in an exponential-sized graph, for which we use model checking algorithms (e.g.&nbsp;IC3). We have implemented our algorithm and demonstrated its efficacy on benchmarks that are derived from cross-site scripting analysis and other examples in the literature.},

  abstract  = {Analyzing web applications requires reasoning about strings and non-strings cohesively. Existing string solvers either ignore non-string program behavior or support limited set of string operations. In this paper, we develop a general purpose string solver, called Z3-str, as an extension of the Z3 SMT solver through its plug-in interface. Z3-str treats strings as a primitive type, thus avoiding the inherent limitations observed in many existing solvers that encode strings in terms of other primitives. The logic of the plug-in has three sorts, namely, bool, int and string. The string-sorted terms include string constants and variables of arbitrary length, with functions such as concatenation, sub-string, and replace. The int-sorted terms are standard, with the exception of the length function over string terms. The atomic formulas are equations over string terms, and (in)-equalities over integer terms. Not only does our solver have features that enable whole program symbolic, static and dynamic analysis, but also it performs better than other solvers in our experiments. The application of Z3-str in remote code execution detection shows that its support of a wide spectrum of string operations is key to reducing false positives.},
